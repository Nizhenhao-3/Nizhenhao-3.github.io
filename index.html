# Welcome

{:.lead}

Hi, I'm **Zhenhao Ni**. Welcome to my personal website.

I'm passionate about **Robot Learning** and **Simulation**, exploring how intelligent systems can learn and adapt in complex environments. My research focuses on developing robotic systems that can transfer learned behaviors from simulation to reality, enabling safer and more efficient autonomous operations.

## Research Interests

I'm passionate about advancing the field of **Robot Learning** and **Simulation**.

My research focuses on developing intelligent robotic systems that can learn from experience and adapt to complex, real-world environments. Through simulation and machine learning, I explore how robots can acquire new skills, improve their performance, and operate safely in dynamic settings.

## Background

I'm currently working on projects that bridge the gap between simulation and reality, enabling robots to transfer learned behaviors from virtual environments to physical systems. This work involves:

- **Reinforcement Learning** for robotic control
- **Sim-to-Real Transfer** techniques
- **Robotic Manipulation** and **Navigation**
- **Multi-Agent Systems** in robotics

Learn more about my research and background on the [About](/about/) page.
