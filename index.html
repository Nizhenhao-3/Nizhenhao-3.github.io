# Welcome

{:.lead}

Hi, I'm **Zhenhao Ni**. Welcome to my personal website.

I'm passionate about **Robot Learning** and **Simulation**, exploring how intelligent systems can learn and adapt in complex environments. My research focuses on developing intelligent robotic systems that can learn from experience and transfer knowledge from simulation to reality.

## Research Focus

My work spans several key areas:

- **Reinforcement Learning** for robotic control and decision-making
- **Sim-to-Real Transfer** to bridge the gap between virtual and physical worlds
- **Robotic Manipulation** and autonomous navigation
- **Multi-Agent Systems** for collaborative robotics
