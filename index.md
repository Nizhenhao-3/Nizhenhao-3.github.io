# About


I am a Remote Research Intern at the [Physical Superintelligence (PSI) Lab](https://psi-lab.ai/) at the **University of Southern California**, supervised by Prof. [Yue Wang](https://yuewang.xyz/), starting from July 2025. My research interests lie in **Simulation** and **Embodied AI**, with a particular focus on addressing data scarcity in robotic learning.
