# About

<!--author-->

## Research Interests

I'm passionate about advancing the field of **Robot Learning** and **Simulation**.

{:toc .large-only}

My research focuses on developing intelligent robotic systems that can learn from experience and adapt to complex, real-world environments. Through simulation and machine learning, I explore how robots can acquire new skills, improve their performance, and operate safely in dynamic settings.

## Background

I'm currently working on projects that bridge the gap between simulation and reality, enabling robots to transfer learned behaviors from virtual environments to physical systems. This work involves:

- **Reinforcement Learning** for robotic control
- **Sim-to-Real Transfer** techniques
- **Robotic Manipulation** and **Navigation**
- **Multi-Agent Systems** in robotics
